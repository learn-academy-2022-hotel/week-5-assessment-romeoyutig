# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does calling super do in a class?

Your answer: Calling a super causes a class to inherit all of its properties, without having to initialize it again.

Researched answer: Calling super causes the Superclass to pass down information to the subclass. This interaction is called inheritance, and is used by the "<" character. A subclass will inherit all of the data that the Superclass provides. The super must also be invoked in the initialization, before instance variables are declared.
